# pXRF

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)

The goal of pXRF is to help with the evaluation of pxrf data, especially at the moment from the Nitonâ„¢ XL3t XRF Analyzer.

This package is not in a production state yet!!!

Meanwhile, it is used to present a evaluation strategy to a pxrf course at Bern University. You can access the rendered Rmarkdown-Documents that will result in the package functionality, but for the time being just show the workflow using other packages, here:

- [basic_functionality.md](vignettes/basic_functionality.md) is actually how you can load pXRF data and preprocess them.
- [analysis.md](vignettes/analysis.md) represents analytical procedures from simple scatterplots to pca and lda
- [fine_calibration.md](vignettes/fine_calibration.md) explains how you can come up with fine calibration for our specific device

Work in Progress!!!

## Installation

You can install the development version of pXRF from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MartinHinz/pXRF")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(pXRF)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
